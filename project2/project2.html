<h1>Project 2 Final Submission</h1>
<p>Provide instructions on how course staff can create a login for them to use to test your system:</p>
<p>Staff members can go to our main page: http://webdev.cse.msu.edu/~user/project2 and click on sign up. <br>
    From there type in email and a name to be referred in game, you will be sent an email for validation. <br>
    Check spam in case validation email was put in spam folder. After clicking on the link you will be brought to a set account page. <br>
    Here you will put your password for said account. Then you may go back to the homepage and log in.
</p>
<p>Please indicate your team members and the task assignment for each member:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Amy Leung - Interface features for two player games</li>
    <li>Vincent Ma - User management and transitioning the site to less.</li>
    <li>Joe Schmitz - Server Side</li>
</ul>

<p>*Note: Each member was very involved in all parts. Took place in group meetings. </p>
<p>*When entering a game, if you click on radio button it does take you to a 404 Error. We did our best to get this completed, <br>
 but sadly we were not able to do so with other pressing matters to take care of.
